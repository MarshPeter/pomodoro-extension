# Pomodoro Chrome Extension

## Functionality for final product

- Contains a pomodoro timer, where the user can control the duration of the timer or default to 25 minutes.
- At the end of the duration, the timer will stop and an sound will be made to notify the user.
- The user can enter various websites into a 'productivity blacklist'.
- While the pomodoro timer is active, the 'productivity blacklist' will disallow the user to access those websites.
